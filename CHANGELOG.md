## Summary of Changes to `src/components/InfoCard.tsx`

We've made several iterations to the `InfoCard` component to achieve a dynamic and visually appealing design, especially for course titles and instructor images.

1.  **Instructor Image Integration:**
    *   Added a `personImage` prop to `InfoCardProps` to display an instructor's photo.
    *   Modified `Presenciales.tsx` to pass the `personImage` from `course` data to `InfoCard`.
    *   Corrected the image path for "Abelardo-neutro.png" in `src/data/courses.tsx`.
    *   **Current State:** Abelardo's image is displayed on the "Acento Neutro" card.

2.  **Image Positioning and Sizing:**
    *   Moved the `personImage` to the **bottom-left corner** of the card (`absolute bottom-0 -left-4`).
    *   Increased its size (`w-full max-w-[280px]`).
    *   **Current State:** Abelardo's image is larger and positioned in the bottom-left, with a slight negative left margin to hide the cut-off arm.

3.  **Card Minimum Height for Responsiveness:**
    *   Added a conditional `min-h-[460px]` to the card's container `div` when `personImage` is present.
    *   **Current State:** Cards with instructor images maintain a minimum height on smaller screens to prevent the image from being cut off.

4.  **"Ver Detalles" Button Redesign:**
    *   Initially, the button was changed to a small, circular icon (`ArrowRightIcon`) positioned in the **bottom-right corner** when `personImage` is present.
    *   **Current State:** The button is a small, circular icon in the bottom-right corner for cards with `personImage`. For other cards, it remains a standard text button.

5.  **Top Icon Removal:**
    *   Made the `icon` prop optional in `InfoCardProps`.
    *   Removed the rendering of the top icon `div` from the component.
    *   Adjusted the card's top padding (`pt-12`) to compensate for the removed icon's space.
    *   **Current State:** The top icon is no longer displayed on any `InfoCard`.

6.  **Dynamic Title Styling (Blue Stripe):**
    *   Implemented a conditional rendering for the title based on its length:
        *   **Short Titles (`title.length <= 14`):** Displayed in a **single blue stripe**.
            *   Stripe is `w-full h-10 md:h-12`, `bg-accent-blue`, `transform -rotate-2`, `px-4`, `shadow-lg`.
            *   Title text is `text-white text-3xl font-bold text-center whitespace-nowrap`.
        *   **Medium Titles (`title.length <= 30`):** Displayed in **two stripes** (blue and orange).
            *   A `splitTitleForTwoStripes` helper function was added to divide the title into two parts.
            *   **Blue Stripe (top):** `absolute top-0 right-0 w-full h-10 bg-accent-blue flex items-center justify-center transform -rotate-2 px-4 shadow-lg`.
            *   **Orange Stripe (bottom):** `absolute bottom-0 right-0 w-full h-10 bg-accent-orange flex items-center justify-center px-4 shadow-lg`.
            *   Title text for both parts is `text-white text-2xl font-bold text-center whitespace-nowrap`.
            *   The parent container for two stripes has `h-20`.
        *   **Very Long Titles (`title.length > 30`):** Revert to a **simple `h3` title** (`text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-accent-blue`).
    *   **Current State:** The title styling is dynamic based on length, with single blue stripe for short titles, two stripes for medium titles, and simple `h3` for very long titles.

7.  **Stripe Overlap Adjustment:**
    *   Adjusted the `bottom` property of the orange stripe from `bottom-2` to `bottom-0` to reduce overlap.
    *   **Current State:** The orange stripe touches the blue stripe without significant overlap.

## Current Point in the Conversation

We are currently at a point where the user is happy with the overall design of the `InfoCard` component, including the dynamic title styling and image positioning. The last specific request was to reduce the overlap between the two stripes, which I have implemented.

**Next Step:** I am waiting for the user's feedback on the reduced overlap of the stripes.
